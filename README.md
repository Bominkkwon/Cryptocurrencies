## Project title
Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Technologies
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Download Python") 3.7.9.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment and to make an analysis for my clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, it would make sense for us to use unsupervised learning. 
We have taken these steps to create visualizations to share our findings with the board:
1.  Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2.  Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3.  Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4.  Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
